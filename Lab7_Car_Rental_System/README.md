## Overview
A Java-based car rental automation system demonstrating object-oriented design principles.

## Concepts Used
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Interfaces (Rentable, Insurable)
- Polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch
- Method overloading
- Static method hiding
- Composition (RentalContract)

## Description
The system models cars and trucks with different pricing and insurance rules.
Rental contracts compute total cost dynamically based on vehicle type and options.

## Outcome
Successfully implemented a modular and extensible rental system using core OOP principles.
