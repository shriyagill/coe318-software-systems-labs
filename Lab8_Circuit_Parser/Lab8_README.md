## Overview
A Java program that parses a text-based circuit description and outputs a SPICE-compatible format.

## Concepts Used
- Input parsing
- Object modeling of circuit components
- Data validation
- String formatting
- Program control flow

## Description
The program reads resistor and voltage source definitions, stores them internally,
and outputs a formatted SPICE representation upon request.

## Outcome
Demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and the ability to translate specifications into working code.
